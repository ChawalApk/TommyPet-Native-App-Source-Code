Take your pet on a long walk with this 3-in-1 Collapsible Pet Travel Bowl. It's perfect for road trips, picnics and beach or near home activities. You'll have a handy water bowl in the car, while you're out exploring and when they need to drink at home as well! The collapsible design also serves as a carrying bolus, so you can take it with you anywhere!
The 3-in-1 Collapsible TommyePet Germany Travel Bowl is made of durable silicone and BPA free plastics. It's dishwasher safe on the top rack. Large: 8.75" x 5.5" x 1.25", Medium: 6" x 4" x 1", Small: 4" x 1.5". Colors vary, but all bowl sizes come in Blue, Pink or Purple.
The Kong dog toy has been a classic for over 30 years now, and comes in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit any dog's play style.  Made from durable rubber, these tough toys are great for all power chewers but especially recommended for dogs with soft mouths or puppy teeth or small breeds who may not be as strong as others.
Pros: This is one of the few dog toys that are durable enough to withstand a strong chewer and an aggressive power chewer. It has a great bounce to it and is able to withstand almost any amount of chewing. Yes, this toy is a bit pricey but it can last for years and it's worth every penny!
Cons: I wouldn't classify this as a "cons" per say but I do have to say that Zuke's balls are not indestructible. They can be easily punctured through by other objects or even your dog's teeth.
